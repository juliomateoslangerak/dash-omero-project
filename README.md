OMERO.omero_metrics
=======================

An dashboard to visualize microscope-metrics data in OMERO.

Installation
============

Install `omero_metrics` in development mode as follows:

    # within your python venv:
    $ cd omero-metrics
    $ pip install -e .

Add the app to the `omero.web.apps` setting:

N.B. Here we use single quotes around double quotes:

    $ omero config append omero.web.apps '"omero_metrics"'

Optionally, add a link "OMERO metrics" at the top of the webclient to
open the index page of this app:

    $ omero config append omero.web.ui.top_links '["OMERO metrics", "omero_metrics_index", {"title": "Open OMERO metrics in new tab", "target": "_blank"}]'


Now restart your `omero-web` server and go to
<http://localhost:4080/omero_metrics/> in your browser.
